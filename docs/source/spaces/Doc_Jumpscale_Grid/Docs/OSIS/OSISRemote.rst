Remote OSIS server
##################


It is possible to store the osis objects on a remote OSIS server.
There is minimal spec change to do this.
Add osis as dbtype to your model spec.

From that moment your object will be stored and available on the remove osis server.

Example:


TODO:

**Enable OSIS in pyapp
**Configure serives(probably part of grid configuration, at this point(28/05/2013) your osis server should be running on the same server)

  * Extend the osis actions(at this moment only create/get/delete)


Small Demo
