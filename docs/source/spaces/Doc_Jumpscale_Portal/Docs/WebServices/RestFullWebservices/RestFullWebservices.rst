It is also possible to use CRUD actions on your defined objects.

To allow this, you need to specify your objects.
And then adapt the generated CRUD functions to your expected behaviour.

The url structure is always like this:


The system app has a simple example to demonstrate this.
It contains one object a *book*.

So the following calls are possible.

List all books

Create a book


The data field of the post contains then the parameters.
E.g for a application/x-www-form-urlencoded content this will name=Lord Of the Rings&summary=Fantasy Epos


Returs book with id 3


Deletes book 3


It is important to understand that the id always is passed to the function as id.

E.g in the above example is 3 the value of the id argument.


Using AngularJS.
