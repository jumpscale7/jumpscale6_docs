User Management
***************


The system users & groups come from the config dir

users.cfg
and optionally
groups.cfg

This links to a file of structure




.. code-block:: python

  [admin]
  passwd=1234
  groups=admin
  reset=1
  emails= 
  secret=
  
  [anotheruser]
  passwd=123456
  emails=


If groups is not filled in then user will be part of the group guests.
When reset=1 then the user info will be overwritten when appserver loads, everything in DB for that user will be overwritten.
If reset 0 then the user will only be created if the user does not exist yet.
When reset=1 the secret needs to be empty or filled in, same for groups.

This file has priority on users.cfg files specified on space, bucket or actor level.

Emails is comma separated list of email addresses, when not filled in it is not used.

Secret is the authkey used to get a special url which does automatic login of the user
Rhe url looks as follows:
http://$addr/$space?authkey=$secret
e.g.
http://192.198.93.21/generic_funding_info_453?authkey=dwfasdfasdf157

If not filled in will be filled in automatically
When secret is empty then will not be generated (recommend this for admin users, do not make secret keys !!!!)



remarks
=======


users as defined in spaces, buckets & actors can never be put in admin group
The reset param is only used in the main usersfile, cannot not be used in spaces,buckets & actor usercfg files.



Allow guest access
==================


It is possible to allow guest access to certain spaces.
Todo the following has to be configured.


* Create a guest user in users.cfg
* Define a acl for the guest user.


Example content of users.cfg




.. code-block:: python

  [guest]
  reset = 1
  id = guest
  passwd = 
  secret = c812013bd
  emails = 
  groups = guest
  system =


Example content of .space/acl.cfg





.. code-block:: python

  #rights:
  ##R: read
  ##W: write/modify
  ##S: sync to e.g. local PC
  ##A: admin rights
  ##*: means all rights
  guest=R
  admin=*
