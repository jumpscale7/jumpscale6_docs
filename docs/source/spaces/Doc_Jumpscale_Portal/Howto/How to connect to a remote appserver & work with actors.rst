Loading and working with actors remotely
========================================


In order to be able to connect to a remote appserver, you'll have to provide the following to the getPortalClient call:

1. ip: the IP of the remote appserver
2. port: the port on which Nginx is listening
3. secret: appserver secret token





.. code-block:: python

  import JumpScale.portal
  cl = j.core.portal.getPortalClient(ip='<REMOTE-APPSERVER-IP>', port=80, secret="1234")
  ma = cl.getActor("system", "master")
  ma.ping()
