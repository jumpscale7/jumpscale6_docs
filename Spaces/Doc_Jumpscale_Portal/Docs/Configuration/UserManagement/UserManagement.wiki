h3. Allow guest access

It is possible to allow guest access to certain spaces.
Todo the following has to be configured:

* Define a acl for the guest user.

Example content of .space/acl.cfg 

{{code:
#rights:
##R: read
##W: write/modify
##S: sync to e.g. local PC
##A: admin rights
##*: means all rights
guest=R
admin=*
}}

h3. jsuser command-line tool

To begin with, you can use the command 'jsuser list' to list all the available users on the system.

{{code:
~# jsuser list
name                 domain                    groups
================================================================================
admin                                          admin
}}

In order to add users to groups, you can use jsuser command as follows:

{{code:
``~# jsuser addgroup -gu admin -gg test``
}}

With -gu option and give it the user you want to add to a certain group, and -gg option and give it the group name. You can run jsuser list command afterwards to check that the user was successfully added to the group.

{{code:
~# jsuser list
name                 domain                    groups
================================================================================
admin                                          admin,test
}}
