h3. Installing the Portal
The JumpScale portal requires the JumpScale framework to be installed. So if you didn't do so [install JumpScale|UbuntuManual].
{{code:
apt-get update
apt-get install mercurial ssh python2.7 python-apt openssl ca-certificates python-pip ipython -y
pip install https://bitbucket.org/jumpscale/jumpscale_core/get/unstable.zip
jpackage mdupdate
jpackage install -n core
}}

In the above code we installed the unstable version. Replace unstable.zip by default.zip to install the latest stable version.

After installing the JumpScale framework, you can install the portal.
{{code:
jpackage install -n portal
}}

During the install you will need to enter a a name for the Elasticsearch application and an encryption key for the OSIS database.

Start the portal by starting the necessary processes:
{{code:
jsprocess start
}}

This completes the steps to install the JumpScale portal. Now you can [create a new portal|How to get started] or import an existing project from BitBucket. In the below example we will make the JumpScale Documentation portal in our newly installed poral.

Edit $jumpscaledir/cfg/jpackages/sources.cfg and add the Incubaid domain.
{{code:
[incubaid]
metadatafromtgz = 0
qualitylevel = unstable
metadatadownload = 
metadataupload = 
bitbucketaccount = incubaid
bitbucketreponame = jp_incubaid
blobstorremote = jpackages_remote
blobstorlocal = jpackages_local
}}

Update the metadata and install and start the Incubaid portals. 
{{code:
jpackage mdupdate
jpackage install -n  portals_base
jpackage start -n portals_base
}}
When asked provide a free port on your host to serve the webpages. You can now see browse to the portal on http://<your IP address>:<port>

Next download the documentation package
{{code:
jpackage install -n doc_jumpscale
}}
