h2. Admin Principles

h3. Selection of Nodes

h4. -r

* specify the hostname
* if -o (specifies the grid) is not used then the active grid will be used, the active grid is the first grid which is encountered in file:///opt/jumpscale/cfg/admin/active.cfg
** the first one marked with *... (reading from top down)

{{code:
* Lenoir2
cpu01
cpu02
* York1
cpu01

}}

examples:
* -r cpu01 : the cpu01 node from lenoir2 is selected
* -r cpu01 -o york1 : cpu01 from york is selected
* -r cpu03 : cpu03 from Lenoir2 is selected (if cpu03 does not exist in Lenoir2 then error)

h4. -r and -o are used

* specifies the gridname & nodename
* if combination not found -> error

h4. only -o is used

* all nodes from file:///opt/jumpscale/cfg/admin/active.cfg above ### (the active nodes) are chosen from appriopriate grid, if none: Error

h4. no -o and no - r is used

* illegal, error

h4. no -o and no - r is used but --roles is specified

* the nodes with the appropriate roles are looked for over all grids

h4. -o and --roles are specified

* the nodes with the appropriate roles are looked for for the specified grid, if not found -> error

h4. -g and --roles are specified

* consult the OSIS grid database get the hostnames from there using the roles
* only works against the locally configured grid osis DB (so not over grids)
