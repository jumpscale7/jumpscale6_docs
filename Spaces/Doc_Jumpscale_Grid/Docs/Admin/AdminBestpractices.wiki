h2. Admin Best Practices

You can run the jsadmin & jsexec from sandbox mode but we recommend that you work from development jumpscale.
It makes it easier to deploy & maintain you jumpscripts.
It also makes sense to combine with a buildserver, in other words the admin server = build server.
Which means sandbox & development version are both installed but you work from the development version.
