apt-get upgrade
}}

h5. Install the sandbox

{{code: template:shell
curl http://install.jumpscale.org:85/cmds/jsbox_stable.sh > /tmp/init.sh;sh /tmp/init.sh
source /opt/jsbox/activate
js
}}


h5. Update the jpackage metadata

Run the following command:

{{code: template:shell
jssync download -c jpackages -k test
#or for stable
jssync download -c jpackages -k unstable
}}


h5. install jumpscale documentation in a development env which is also master
just do
{{code:
jpackage install -n redis
jpackage install -n grid_master_singlenode
#creates user admin with passwd admin for grid_portal
jsuser add -d admin:admin:admin:ikk@com:jumpscale 
#visit localhost:81 to see gridportal
jpackage install -n doc_jumpscale
}}

this will install all components required to work with the documentation from a local portal.
This will also install osis, elasticsearch, processmanager, redis
