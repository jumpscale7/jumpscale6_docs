h3. JumpScale vs Pylabs

This page is intended for people who are familiar with Pylabs. People who do not know Pylabs should not read this.

h5. j is the new q

The j name space replaces the complete q name space.
The i and p name spaces are removed (as for now).


h5. No more InitBase

Loading JumpScale is as simple as import j from JumpScale:

{{code:
from JumpScale import j
j.logger.log('test')
}}



h5. Modules versus Extensions

Extensions are replaced by modules.
Instead of making an extension.cfg file, you write an \_\_init\_\_ file in which you define the extension hooking.
Modules are not automatically loaded. If your code relies on a module, you have to explicitly import it.


In pylabs:

{{code:
#!cfg

[hook_hash]
classname = HumanReadableDataFactory
modulename = HumanReadableData
enabled = 1
qlocation = q.core.hrd
}}


In JumpScale
{{code:
from JumpScale import j
from .HumanReadableData import HumanReadableDataFactory
j.base.loader.makeAvailable(o, 'core')
j.core.hrd = HumanReadableDataFactory()
}}


Import as follows:
{{code:
import JumpScale.baselib.hrd
}}
