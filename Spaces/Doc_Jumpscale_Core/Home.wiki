h3. JumpScale Core Docs

This is the getting started page for JumpScale.
JumpScale is a branch from what used to be Pylabs. About 5 years ago Pylabs was the basis of a cloud automation product which was acquired by SUN Microsystems from a company called Q-Layer.
In the mean time we are 3 versions further and we rebranded to JumpScale.

Please visit www.jumpscale.org & www.jumpscale.com for more information about our products.
