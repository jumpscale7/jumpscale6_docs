h4. image location

images are on rsync server (today 16-4-2014: install.jumpscale.org)

param configured in: hrd
jssync.addr=95.85.60.252

h4. key approach

each image is uploaded to a location on rsync server prepended with this key,
this key can be a secret
in this example the key is an existing set of images underneath key:'testâ€™

To update e.g. base image on key:test


h3. prerequisites

make sure lxc is properly installed (see [HowToUseLXCInstall])

make sure jssync is installed

{{code:
jpackage install -n jssync
}}

h3. download base machine

{{code:
jsmachine importR -n base -m base -k test
}}

(this means get image base from key:test onto local machine called  base)

machine is now under /mnt/btrfs/lxc/base/ (for these howto's we will always use /mnt/btrfs/lxc as base for lxc)
