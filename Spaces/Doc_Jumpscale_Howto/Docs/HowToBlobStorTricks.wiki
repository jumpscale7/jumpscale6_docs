h2. How to play tricks with blobstor 1

h3. example config

{{code:

[jpackages_local]
ftp =
type = local
http =
localpath = /opt/jpackagesftp
namespace = jpackages

[jpackages_remote]
ftp = ftp://jpackages:rooter@jpackages.vscalers.com
#ftp = ftp://iaas:arakoon@publicrepo.incubaid.com
type = ftp
localpath =
namespace = jpackages

}}

h3. run your own blobstor server

see also [HowToRunYourOwnBlobStorServer]

this is ideal to use when you play with LXC containers.
You don't want to download everything to a local dir in each container, this allows you to run one locally on the host & each LXC container gets it from there.
When there is a cache miss then the blob gets downloaded from remote into local which is also a local ftp server (blobserver)

{{code:
[jpackages_local]
ftp = ftp://jpackages:rooter@10.10.253.1
type = ftp
localpath =
namespace = jpackages
}}


h3. copy relevant jpackage blobs to a new jpackages blobstor

add something like to the blobstorconfig
{{code:
[jpackages_new]
ftp = ftp://jpackages:rooter@localhost
type = ftp
localpath =
namespace = jpackages
}}

now use the following command
{{code:
jpackage upload --blobserver=jpackages_new --onlyexistingblobs -d jumpscale
}}

example for domain: jumpscale

this will download all jpackages from local or remote store & then upload to the jpackages_new
