h2. How Documentation works

This documentation gets converted from wiki syntax to rst syntax every day by [Jenkins| http://10.101.190.1/view/JumpScale/job/Documentation].
It then pushes the rsts to the [generated_docs repo|https://github.com/Jumpscale/generated_docs].

[ReadTheDocs|http://jumpscale-docs.readthedocs.org/] will rebuild the sphinx documentation everytime a commit is made to the Generated_Docs, thus always displaying the latest code.

h5. To create documentation yourself
{{code:
jsdocs generate
}}

which will convert files to .rst locally and attempt to commit them to the generated docs repo by:

* Updating the core code base
* Updating the documentation code base
* Updating the generated docs
* Running the conversion script
* Committing changes to generated docs

Make sure that you have access to the generated_docs repo and all merge conflicts are resolved.
